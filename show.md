I started reading regularly in Dec'2019 and have not stopped since. I enjoy fiction the most
but occasionally also try books around personal-development, biographies, etc.

I use this page to get myself into the habit of writing more. Below you can find
a list of my recommended books; books that I have read recently; and, some
random ramblings around the same.

I am quite active on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33989424-ankit-sultana)
as well.
